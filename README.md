AI Pathfinding in 15x15 Maps
This project implements artificial intelligence algorithms to find optimal paths in 15x15 grid maps. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* (A-Star) to explore routes from a starting point to a goal, avoiding obstacles and measuring performance. The code includes map validation, execution time tracking, and visual output using Matplotlib. Each map is defined with . for free space and # for obstacles, and the algorithms return detailed metrics such as number of steps, nodes explored, and time taken. The project is ideal for studying search strategies, comparing algorithm efficiency, and visualizing pathfinding in grid-based environments.
To run the project, install the required libraries with pip install matplotlib numpy, then execute the script with python trabalhoia.py. The output includes console summaries and graphical visualizations of the paths found by each algorithm. This repository is designed to support future improvements, experimentation, and collaboration.
