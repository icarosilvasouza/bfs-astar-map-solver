# bfs-astar-map-solver
I'm creating a GitHub repository to organize my AI project that finds paths in 15x15 maps using BFS and A* algorithms. It includes test maps, visualizations with matplotlib, and performance metrics. This helps share code, track changes, and support future improvements or collaboration.
